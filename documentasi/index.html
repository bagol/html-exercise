            JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming
            language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by
            Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla
            Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation).
          </p>

          <p>
            JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience,
            you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics,
            comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!
          </p>

          <p>
            JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible.
            Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core
            JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with
            minimum effort. These include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web
              browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating
              HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video
              stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio
              samples.
            </li>
            <li>
              Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate
              functionality in sites from other content providers, such as
              Twitter or Facebook.
            </li>
            <li>
              hird-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to
              accelerate the work of building sites and applications.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It's outside the scope of this article—as a light introduction to
            JavaScript—to present the details of how the core JavaScript
            language is different from the tools listed above. You can learn
            more in MDN's JavaScript learning area, as well as in other parts of
            MDN.

            The section below introduces some aspects of the core language and
            offers an opportunity to play with a few browser API features too.
            Have fun!

            avaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As
            your JavaScript skills grow, your websites will enter a new
            dimension of power and creativity.

            However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging
            than getting comfortable with HTML and CSS. You may have to start
            small, and progress gradually. To begin, let's examine how to add
            JavaScript to your page for creating a Hello world! example. (Hello
            world! is the standard for introductory programming examples.)
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Go to your test site and create a new folder named scripts. Within
              the scripts folder, create a new file called main.js, and save it.
            </li>
            <li>
              In your index.html file, enter this code on a new line, just
              before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag
              <code> &lt;script src="scripts/main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; </code>
            </li>
            <li>
              This is doing the same job as the &lt;link&gt; element for CSS. It
              applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect on
              the HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the page).
            </li>
            <li>
              Add this code to the main.js file:
              <code>
                const myHeading = document.querySelector('h1'); <br />
                myHeading.textContent = 'Hello world!';
              </code>
            </li>
            <li>
              Make sure the HTML and JavaScript files are saved. Then load
              index.html in your browser. You should see something like this:
            </li>
          </ol>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="What_Happened_?">
        <header>What happened ?</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            The heading text changed to Hello world! using JavaScript. You did
            this by using a function called querySelector() to grab a reference
            to your heading, and then store it in a variable called myHeading.
            This is similar to what we did using CSS selectors. When you want to
            do something to an element, you need to select it first.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following that, the code set the value of the myHeading variable's
            textContent property (which represents the content of the heading)
            to Hello world!.

            To give you a better understanding of how JavaScript works, let's
            explain some of the core features of the language. It's worth noting
            that these features are common to all programming languages. If you
            master these fundamentals, you have a head start on coding in other
            languages too!

          <p>
            ariables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a
            variable with the var (less recommended, dive deeper for the
            explanation) or the let keyword, followed by the name you give to
            the variable:
            <code> let myVariable; </code>
            After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:
            <code>myVariable = 'Bob';</code>
            Also, you can do both these operations on the same line:
            <code> let myVariable = 'Bob'; </code>
            You retrieve the value by calling the variable name:
            <code>myVariable; </code>
            After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in
            the code:
            <code>
              let myVariable = 'Bob'; <br />
              myVariable = 'Steve';
            </code>
